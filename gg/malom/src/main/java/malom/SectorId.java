/**
 * The state space is subdivided into sectors. A sector is identified by the numbers of stones on the board for each
 * of the players, and the numbers of stones to be placed on the board for each of the players.
 *
 * Note, that you can "negate" a game state in the following sense: switch the colors of all stones on the board,
 * switch the number of stones to be placed, and switch the player-to-move. A game state and its negation are clearly
 * equivalent states, so we can eliminate one of them from our state space. This involves "normalizing" all game states
 * that pop up during the computation. (That is, when we see an eliminated state, we change it to the corresponding
 * non-eliminated state).
 * The question that remains, is which of the two corresponding states should be eliminated. One way would be to
 * have only states where white has at least as many stones on the board as black (Gasser's way (I think)).
 * But we have chosen to eliminate all the states where black is to move.
